### Install a Python IDE

I recommend [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) from [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com).  
It's available as a paid versions, but it also has a free community version.  
But you can use any other IDE or text editor you like.  
The advantage of using a Python IDE is that it usually installs Python for you and helps you keep it up to date.  
If you are just using a text editor then you have to install and maintain [Python](https://www.python.org) yourself.
